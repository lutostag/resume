# Resume

## About me

I am an experienced developer/architect/team-lead currently living in Austin, TX. I am most fulfilled building and shipping quality product as part of a skilled and motivated team. I am currently happily employed at The Mobility House.

### Motivations

* Working on a large scale problem -- a project that has impact
* Collaborating with smart/skillful people
* Distilling complexity down to a great product
* Quality work that is maintainable

## Why

Keeping my resume updated was always a hassle, keeping a historical record I could go back into and see revisions was difficult as the content/formatting would often change independently.
